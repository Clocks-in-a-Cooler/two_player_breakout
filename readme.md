# Two-Player Breakout

Breakout, for two players using Node.js, socket.io, and express.

Play by starting the server and getting a partner to connect.

## Starting the server

Get a command terminal and type `node main.js`. The default port is `3000`, but you can specify a default with `node main.js (your desired port)`.
